Never Split the Difference 
* Open ended questions
* “One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem
*  two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want 
* three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options
* four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions”

* Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.”
* Labelling negative emotions diffuses them; labelling positive emotions reinforces them
* Accusation audit-ever worst possible thing that your counterpart could say about you. To bend your counterpart’s reality, you have to start with the basics of empathy. So start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it.”
*  Calibrated questions
* What about this is important to you?”
* “How can I help to make this better for us?

* How would you like me to proceed?

* What is it that brought us into this situation?

* How can we solve this problem?

* What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?

* How am I supposed to do that?”
* What are we trying to accomplish?
* How does making a deal with us affect things?
* Non cash offers
* “Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don’t want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”
* “Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you is by forcing them into a “No.” That means intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or”“asking a ridiculous question—like, “It seems like you want this project to fail”—that can only be answered negatively.”
* “That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.”
* “Mirroring: Rather than argue with Sabaya and try to separate Schilling from the “war damages,” Benjie would listen and repeat back what Sabaya said.

* Labeling: Benjie should give Sabaya’s feelings a name and identify with how he felt. “It all seems so tragically unfair, I can now see why you sound so angry.”
* “Paraphrase: Benjie should repeat what Sabaya is saying back to him in Benjie’s own words. This, we told him, would powerfully show him you really do understand and aren’t merely parroting his concerns.”
* Pivot to non monetary terms

How to negotiate a successful salary
* Be pleasantly persistent in non salary terms 
* Spark interest in your success and gain an unofficial mentor- what does it take to be successful here?
* Open-ended questions 
* “What about this is important to you?”
* “How can I help to make this better for us?

* How would you like me to proceed?

* What is it that brought us into this situation?

* How can we solve this problem?

* What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?

* How am I supposed to do that?”
* What are we trying to accomplish?
* How does making a deal with us affect things?

Ackerman model
“1.Set your target price (your goal).

2.Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.

3.Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).

4.Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.

5.When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.

6.On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they don’t want and to show them you’re at your limit)
