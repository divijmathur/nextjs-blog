	⁃	Why should our customers buy from us over anyone else? (unique value of our solution)

	⁃	Small number of powerful insights along with 2-3 easy to remember diagnostic questions designed to map the right insight to the right customer. 
	⁃	Segment customers by need or behavior
	⁃	Finding customers with similar needs will lead to similar reactions to a common set of insights.  

Building Insight-Ful Conversations
	0.	The Warmer
	⁃	Provide benchmarking data by sharing anecdotes from other companies that capture the challenges most likely of highest concern to your customers that corroborate their experience. 
	⁃	Example- We’ve worked with a number of companies similar to yours and have found these three challenges come up again and again as by far the most troubling. Is that what you’re seeing too or would you add something to the list? 
	0.	The Reframe
	⁃	The Reframe is the headline about the insight itself. 
	⁃	Unrecognized problem,need or assumption
	0.	Rational Drowning

	0.	Emotional Impact
	⁃	Painting a picture of how other companies just like the customer’s went down a similarly painful path by engaging in behavior that the customer will recognize as typical of their own company. 
	0.	A New Way

	0.	Your Solution
	⁃	Lay out the specific ways you can deliver the solution better than anyone else (focus on unique benefits that your customers currently under-appreciate)

	⁃	SAFE-small, easy to achieve, follower ideas and easy to implement. (Relationship Builder)

Tailor 
	•	Knowing customer’s value and economic drivers
	•	Decision makers (DM) find the overall sales experience as important as an individual rep’s abilities. 
	•	 DM want suppliers to be accessible, easy to buy from and willing to collaborate with other suppliers if necessary. 
	•	Rep needs to take an indirect path to earn the decision maker’s support by identifying,nurturing and encouraging key customer stakeholders. 
	•	Influencers and stakeholders are looking for reps to teach them about opportunities to make or save money that they didn’t even know were possible



Take Control
	•	Comfortable discussing money (shifting discussion from price to value) 
	⁃	Getting customer to rank elements of offering in order of importance
	•	and can pressure the customer
Taking Control of the Sale
	⁃	Comfortable talking about money
	⁃	Ability to demonstrate and hold firm on value and the ability to maintain momentum across the sales process 
	⁃	Challenger pushes things along, always thinking of the next step. 
	⁃	Mapping out who are key stakeholders, what they care about and why?
	⁃	Taking control has to happen throughout the sale otherwise it ends up feeling fake.

Anatomy of a Successful Negotiation
	•	Acknowledge and Defer
	⁃	I understand that price is something we need to address, but before we do, I’d like to take a moment to make sure I completely understand your needs- so we can make sure we’re doing everything we can to make this deal as valuable as possible for you. Is that all right?
	•	Deepen and Broaden
	⁃	Primary idea is to expand the customer’s view of the things that are important to them. 
	⁃	Get customer to restate things the rep already knows the customer likes about the supplier’s offering
	•	Explore and Compare
	⁃	What else besides price matters?
	⁃	What are you looking to accomplish with a price reduction?
	⁃	Cost to value trade off with the customer
	•	Concede according to Plan
	⁃	Starting with a meaningful concession and then offering smaller and smaller concessions as negotiations continue. 
	•	Make powerful requests helps the customer understand that the rep is here to move things forward.
