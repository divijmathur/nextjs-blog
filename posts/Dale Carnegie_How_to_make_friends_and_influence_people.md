One good technique for converting your enemies (or just non-believers) to your mission is to follow the simple ‘self, us, now’ formula:
* Tell your story / struggle
* Explain why it’s actually ‘our’ struggle, as in why the person you’re talking to also cares
* Explain why we need to take action together now to change things The first step makes you relatable and sympathetic. The second makes your enemy realize that he or she is part of a larger picture and you want the same things in the end. But the last part is the most important. Without a sense of urgency, you don’t get buy-in, you don’t get action.
